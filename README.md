# veml6075-spin 
---------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller 1, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the Vishay VEML6075 UVA/B sensor.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection up to 400kHz
